# rrt_ese680

- I've finished updating occupancy gird map. Please feel free to edit, leave comments, or beautify it. 
- if you wanna visualize the map for now,  launch particle filter -> launch simulator -> run pure_purist -> rrt.launch.   In Rviz, add /by topic : /girdMap. 

- you can ignore cmake-build-debug (that is generated by Clion..)

# TODO:

- Now rrt methods are filled, need to write the main loop and test 
- Need to tune parameters
- Need to integrate with pure purist for trajectory execution 
- Need to Visualize path...

- debug.
